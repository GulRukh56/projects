//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function createCar(manufacturer: string, modelName: string, ...additionalInfo: { [key: string]: any }[]): { manufacturer: string, modelName: string, [key: string]: any } {
  const carInfo: { manufacturer: string, modelName: string, [key: string]: any } = {
    manufacturer,
    modelName,
  };

  for (const info of additionalInfo) {
    for (const key in info) {
      if (info.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        carInfo[key] = info[key];
      }
    }
  }

  return carInfo;
}

// Call the function with required and optional information
const car = createCar("Toyota", "Camry", { color: "Blue", hasSunroof: true });

// Print the returned object
console.log(car);
